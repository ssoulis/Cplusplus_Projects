C++ Projects

INTRODUCTION :

C++ is a cross-platform language that can be used to create high-performance applications.
Object-oriented programming â€“ As the name suggests uses objects in programming. Object-oriented programming aims to implement real-world entities like inheritance, hiding, polymorphism, etc in programming. The main aim of OOP is to bind together the data and the functions that operate on them so that no other part of the code can access this data except that function.

PURPOSE OF PROJECT:
Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that allows you to package together data states and functionality to modify those data states, while keeping the details hidden away. As a result, code with OOP design is flexible, modular, and abstract. This makes it particularly useful when you create larger programs so the purpose is to learn how to effectively program using C++.

VERSION or DATE: WINTER 2019

These are entry level projects, but im eager to learn more about C++ and make better projects.

THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME!
